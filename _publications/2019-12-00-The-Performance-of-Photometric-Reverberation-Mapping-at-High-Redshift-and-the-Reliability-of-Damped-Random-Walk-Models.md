 Accurate methods for reverberation mapping using photometry are highly
sought after since they are inherently less resource intensive than
spectroscopic techniques. However, the effectiveness of photometric
reverberation mapping for estimating black hole masses is sparsely
investigated at redshifts higher than z ≈ 0.04. Furthermore, photometric
methods frequently assume a Damped Random Walk (DRW) model, which may
not be universally applicable. We perform photometric reverberation
mapping using the Javelin photometric DRW model for the QSO
SDSSJ144645.44+625304.0 at z = 0.351 and estimate the Hβ lag of
65\^{+6}*{-1} days and black-hole mass of
10\^{8.22<SUP>+0.13</SUP><SUB>-0.15</SUB> M*{☉}. An analysis of the
reliability of photometric reverberation mapping, conducted using many
thousands of simulated CARMA process light-curves, shows that we can
recover the input lag to within 6 per cent on average given our target's
observed signal-to-noise of \>20 and average cadence of 14 days (even
when DRW is not applicable). Furthermore, we use our suite of simulated
light curves to deconvolve aliases and artefacts from our QSO's
posterior probability distribution, increasing the signal-to-noise on
the lag by a factor of ̃2.2. We exceed the signal-to-noise of the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey Reverberation Mapping Project (SDSS-RM) campaign with
a quarter of the observing time per object, resulting in a ̃ 200 per cent
increase in SNR efficiency over SDSS-RM.
