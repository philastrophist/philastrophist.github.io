 Accurate methods for reverberation mapping using photometry are highly
sought after since they are inherently less resource intensive than
spectroscopic techniques. However, the effectiveness of photometric
reverberation mapping for estimating black hole masses is sparsely
investigated at redshifts higher than $z\approx0.04$. Furthermore,
photometric methods frequently assume a Damped Random Walk (DRW) model,
which may not be universally applicable. We perform photometric
reverberation mapping using the Javelin photometric DRW model for the
QSO SDSSJ144645.44+625304.0 at z=0.351 and estimate the H$\beta$ lag of
$65^{+6}_{-1}$ days and black-hole mass of
$10^{8.22^{+0.13}_{-0.15}}M_{\odot}$. An analysis of the reliability of
photometric reverberation mapping, conducted using many thousands of
simulated CARMA process light-curves, shows that we can recover the
input lag to within 6 per cent on average given our target's observed
signal-to-noise of \> 20 and an average cadence of 14 days (even when
DRW is not applicable). Furthermore, we use our suite of simulated light
curves to deconvolve aliases and artefacts from our QSO's posterior
probability distribution, increasing the signal-to-noise on the lag by a
factor of $\sim2.2$. We exceed the signal-to-noise of the Sloan Digital
Sky Survey Reverberation Mapping Project (SDSS-RM) campaign with a
quarter of the observing time per object, resulting in a $\sim200$ per
cent increase in SNR efficiency over SDSS-RM.
