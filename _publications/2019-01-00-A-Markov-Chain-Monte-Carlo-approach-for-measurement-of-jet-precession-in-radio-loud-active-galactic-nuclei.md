 Jet precession can reveal the presence of binary systems of supermassive
black holes. The abil- ity to accurately measure the parameters of jet
precession from radio-loud AGN is important for constraining the binary
supermassive black hole population, which are expected as a result of
hierarchical galaxy evolution. The age, morphology, and orientation
along the line of sight of a given source often result in uncertainties
regarding jet path. This paper presents a new ap- proach for efficient
determination of precession parameters using a 2D MCMC curve-fitting
algorithm which provides us a full posterior probability distribution on
the fitted parameters. Applying the method to Cygnus A, we find evidence
for previous suggestions that the source is precessing. Interpreted in
the context of binary black holes leads to a constraint of parsec scale
and likely sub-parsec orbital separation for the putative supermassive
binary.
