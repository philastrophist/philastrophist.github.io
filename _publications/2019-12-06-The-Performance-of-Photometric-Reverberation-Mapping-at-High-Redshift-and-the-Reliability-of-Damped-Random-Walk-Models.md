 Accurate methods for reverberation mapping using photometry are highly
sought after since they are inherently less resource intensive than
spectroscopic techniques. However, the effectiveness of photometric
reverberation mapping for estimating black hole masses is sparsely
investigated at redshifts higher than z≈0.04. Furthermore, photometric
methods frequently assume a Damped Random Walk (DRW) model, which may
not be universally applicable. We perform photometric reverberation
mapping using the Javelin photometric DRW model for the QSO
SDSSJ144645.44+625304.0 at z=0.351 and estimate the Hβ lag of
65<sup>+6</sup><sub>-1</sub> days and black-hole mass of
10<sup>8.22<sup>+0.13</sup><sub>-0.15</sub></sup>M<sub>⊙</sub>. An
analysis of the reliability of photometric reverberation mapping,
conducted using many thousands of simulated CARMA process light-curves,
shows that we can recover the input lag to within 6 per cent on average
given our target's observed signal-to-noise of \> 20 and an average
cadence of 14 days (even when DRW is not applicable). Furthermore, we
use our suite of simulated light curves to deconvolve aliases and
artefacts from our QSO's posterior probability distribution, increasing
the signal-to-noise on the lag by a factor of ∼2.2. We exceed the
signal-to-noise of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Reverberation Mapping
Project (SDSS-RM) campaign with a quarter of the observing time per
object, resulting in a ∼200 per cent increase in SNR efficiency over
SDSS-RM.
