 Galaxy morphology is a fundamental quantity, which is essential not only
for the full spectrum of galaxy-evolution studies, but also for a
plethora of science in observational cosmology (e.g. as a prior for
photometric-redshift measurements and as contextual data for transient
light-curve classifications). While a rich literature exists on
morphological-classification techniques, the unprecedented data volumes,
coupled, in some cases, with the short cadences of forthcoming
'Big-Data' surveys (e.g. from the LSST), present novel challenges for
this field. Large data volumes make such data sets intractable for
visual inspection (even via massively distributed platforms like Galaxy
Zoo), while short cadences make it difficult to employ techniques like
supervised machine learning, since it may be impractical to repeatedly
produce training sets on short time-scales. Unsupervised machine
learning, which does not require training sets, is ideally suited to the
morphological analysis of new and forthcoming surveys. Here, we employ
an algorithm that performs clustering of graph representations, in order
to group image patches with similar visual properties and objects
constructed from those patches, like galaxies. We implement the
algorithm on the Hyper-Suprime-Cam Subaru-Strategic-Program Ultra-Deep
survey, to autonomously reduce the galaxy population to a small number
(160) of 'morphological clusters', populated by galaxies with similar
morphologies, which are then benchmarked using visual inspection. The
morphological classifications (which we release publicly) exhibit a high
level of purity, and reproduce known trends in key galaxy properties as
a function of morphological type at z \< 1 (e.g. stellar-mass functions,
rest-frame colours, and the position of galaxies on the star-formation
main sequence). Our study demonstrates the power of unsupervised machine
learning in performing accurate morphological analysis, which will
become indispensable in this new era of deep-wide surveys.
