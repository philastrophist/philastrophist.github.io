 Accurate methods for reverberation mapping using photometry are highly
sought after since they are inherently less resource intensive than
spectroscopic techniques. However, the effectiveness of photometric
reverberation mapping for estimating black hole masses is sparsely
investigated at redshifts higher than z ≈ 0.04. Furthermore, photometric
methods frequently assume a damped random walk (DRW) model, which may
not be universally applicable. We perform photometric reverberation
mapping using the JAVELIN photometric DRW model for the QSO
SDSS-J144645.44+625304.0 at z = 0.351 and estimate the Hβ lag of
65\^{+6}*{-1} d and black hole mass of 10^{8.22^{+0.13}*{-0.15}} M\_{⊙
}. An analysis of the reliability of photometric reverberation mapping,
conducted using many thousands of simulated CARMA process light curves,
shows that we can recover the input lag to within 6 per cent on average
given our target's observed signal-to-noise of \>20 and average cadence
of 14 d (even when DRW is not applicable). Furthermore, we use our suite
of simulated light curves to deconvolve aliases and artefacts from our
QSO's posterior probability distribution, increasing the signal-to-noise
on the lag by a factor of ∼2.2. We exceed the signal-to-noise of the
Sloan Digital Sky Survey Reverberation Mapping Project (SDSS-RM)
campaign with a quarter of the observing time per object, resulting in a
∼200 per cent increase in signal-to-noise efficiency over SDSS-RM.
