## Summary
 I am a postdoctoral researcher specialising in Bayesian statistical analysis on big data, working on the weak-lensing colour-gradient bias with Euclid .
My main interests are reverberation mapping and the interface between star-forming galaxies and AGN. 
I have worked with a diverse range of data including the latest releases from the LOFAR, SDSS, and H-ATLAS surveys and the Horizon-AGN simulations. 
My latest work combines the use of novel statistical Bayesian analysis with these large datasets in order to facilitate effective exploitation of the 
next generation of surveys.



 *Fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society, FRAS*



## Research Interests
* **Star-formation**: LOFAR, FIR, empirical relations, FIRC, MagPhys, SFG-AGN interface.
* **Reverberation mapping**: High redshift, photometric techniques, $$t_{lag}-L_{5100}$$, selection
biases.
* **Big data & Bayesian analysis**: Large surveys, advanced Bayesian statistical inference, bias mitigation.
